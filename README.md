# hello-world
Created to practice GitHub workflow.
My name is Joe Potts.  I'm retired from Humana where I did analysis testing of pharmacy tranactions from the various databases tables. 
I also maintained one of many audit control processes that compared actual pharmacy transaction values to the calculated values resulting from formulas that made up the very large script.
